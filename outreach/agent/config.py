# "send from the platform" actually calls) runs on the HOST from a checkout
# of the same repo -- so the identical hardcoded relative path resolved to
# two completely different directories. The extension's reconnects landed in
# the volume; the control service kept reading its own stale host copy, whose
# files had no auth cookie at all. Every platform-triggered send therefore
# failed with "SessionLoggedOut ... logged_out_chrome=False" (the page was
# just bounced to /login) no matter how many times the account was
# reconnected, on every tenant and both channels.

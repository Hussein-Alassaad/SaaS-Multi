"""
Plain HTTP control endpoint for starting/stopping/checking the scheduler
container (`nexaris-agent`) from the Admin dashboard. Runs as a host-level
process (systemd unit, NOT a Docker container -- see DEPLOY.md's "Agent
control service" section for why: this process needs to run `docker`
commands against the host's Docker daemon, and giving any internet-facing
container access to the Docker socket is a real privilege-escalation risk
this repo deliberately avoids).

Uses Python's stdlib http.server rather than adding a web framework
dependency -- this is exactly one route (`POST /control`) with a small JSON
body in and out, not enough surface to justify FastAPI/Flask.

Run: python -m agent.control.server

"""
Follow-up and re-engagement scheduling and dispatch. Enforces the 2-contact
maximum.

Follow-up is a PER-LEAD decision -- Hussein sets on/off and the exact timing
himself; the agent never picks a delay. Re-engagement covers leads who
replied then went cold. Everything pauses the instant a lead replies (see
reply_detection.py). Max 2 contacts, enforced here at scheduling time, not
left to be silently skipped later.

RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-13: dispatch_due_followups() below closes the gap this
module's docstring used to flag -- due_followups() only ever surfaced what
was due, nothing generated or queued the actual message. Hussein flagged
directly that a follow-up must NOT just repeat the original pitch, so
dispatch generates through messaging/generate.py's generate_followup_message
(a distinct, shorter, non-repeating system prompt -- see that module for
what makes it different from a first message) rather than reusing
generate_message(). The generated follow-up still goes through the normal
approval queue (messages.approval_status defaults to "awaiting") -- a
follow-up is not exempt from Mohamad's review just because it was
auto-triggered by a schedule.

"""
Nexaris AI Outreach Agent — entry point.

Phase 0: this runs a self-check and reports what is configured and what isn't.
It does no real work yet — no browsing, no Claude calls, no sending.

From Phase 2 onward this becomes the daily run loop: for each account, at its own
scheduled time, open a session and work through Tasks 1-17 from the spec.

Run it with:   python -m agent.main

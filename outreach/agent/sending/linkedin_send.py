Sends approved messages on LinkedIn via the account's own session.

============================================================================
VERIFIED against real, live LinkedIn pages on 2026-08-03 -- COMPANY path only
============================================================================
Built and inspected using the already-captured real session for "Hussein's
account" -- read-only DOM inspection only (no message was ever actually sent
during this verification; every click below except the final Send was
exercised live, the Send click itself is exactly what a supervised first
real run should confirm, per the same caution already applied to LinkedIn
discovery in Phase 3).

`leads.profile_url` today is always a **company page** URL
(linkedin.com/company/<slug>/) -- that's the only shape discovery/linkedin.py
produces. This module also handles a **person** profile URL
(linkedin.com/in/<username>/) for whenever a future lead's profile_url is a
specific person instead (e.g. a resolved founder profile) -- see the
"PERSON path" section below for exactly what is and isn't verified there.

COMPANY path (fully verified): some company Pages opt in to a "Message"
action button (`data-test-message-page-button` in
`.org-top-card-primary-actions`) that opens a distinct modal -- LinkedIn's
Page inbox, not the personal inbox. Confirmed this is genuinely inconsistent
between pages, not a universal feature: a real search for "bakery" in
Lebanon (the same search discovery/linkedin.py runs) found it present on a
small business (Paul Bakery Beirut, 135 followers) but absent on a large
brand (Nike). Whether a given lead has it is discovered live, per lead, not
assumed.

That modal (verified via its real DOM, not guessed):
  - `div[role='dialog'][aria-labelledby='msg-shared-modals-msg-page-modal']`
  - a REQUIRED "Conversation topic" `<select>` with a real, stable (non
    ember-generated) id -- options are Service request / Request a demo /
    Support / Careers / Other. None of these are literally "cold outreach",
    so "Other" is used deliberately (see _TOPIC_URN below) rather than
    picking a topic that misrepresents why we're messaging.
  - a message `<textarea>` with a real stable id, `maxlength="750"` and a
    client-enforced "Minimum 25 characters" hint -- both checked before
    sending rather than letting LinkedIn silently reject a too-short or
    too-long message.
  - a "Send message" button, disabled until the two fields above are valid.

============================================================================
PERSON path -- PARTIALLY verified, honestly flagged
============================================================================
"Hussein's account" has 0 connections today, so there was no real person
profile to click "Message" on and inspect live -- unlike every other
UNVERIFIED note elsewhere in this codebase, this one isn't blocked on
login, it's blocked on having a genuine connection to test against.

What IS verified live (on linkedin.com/messaging/thread/new/, LinkedIn's
own full-page compose, reached without needing a specific person): the
shared messaging widget's contenteditable box is
`div.msg-form__contenteditable[contenteditable=true]` and its submit button
is `button.msg-form__send-button` -- both real, stable, non-ember-generated
classes. This widget is the same one LinkedIn embeds site-wide (it's what
renders inside the persistent bottom-right chat overlay too), so reusing
these two selectors after clicking a person's own "Message" button is a
reasonable inference, not a blind guess.

What is NOT verified: the profile page's own "Message" button selector.
`button[aria-label^='Message ']` is used below because the company path's
real button used exactly that aria-label convention
(`aria-label="Message Paul Bakery Beirut"`) -- a11y labels tend to be
consistent site-wide, unlike CSS classes -- but this has not been confirmed
against a real person profile. **The first time a person-shaped lead
actually reaches this code path, watch it closely** before trusting it
unattended, same as the company path's first real send.

    #     pointer events" -- some other element sits on top of the Message
    #     link at the click point (an unidentified sticky/overlay piece;
    #     its exact class hash is LinkedIn-generated and shifts per
    #     page-load, not worth chasing by name).
    # (2) click(force=True) bypassed the interception with no Playwright
    #     error, but genuinely opened nothing -- LinkedIn's own frontend
    #     intercepts this link's click via JS, and that handler needs a
    #     real, trusted click a forced click on an occluded element
    #     doesn't reliably deliver.
    # (3) a normal click, given time to settle first, DID eventually land
    #     and DID trigger a real navigation toward linkedin.com's
    #     Messaging inbox -- but Playwright's own actionability retry loop
    #     inside .click() (repeatedly re-checking "is this element
    #     visible/stable" while the intercepting element kept re-covering
    #     it) was still running WHILE that navigation was already firing
    #     underneath it -- by the time .click() finally "succeeded", the
    #     original link element had already been detached from the DOM
    #     ("element was detached from the DOM, retrying"), because the
    #     page had already moved on.
    # (4) skipping the click entirely and page.goto()-ing the link's own
    #     href directly was tried next -- but LinkedIn redirected that
    #     bare navigation to the plain homepage instead of opening the
    #     compose view. This confirmed the URL isn't a real bookmarkable

    _send_to_person above, which both open a fresh connection request /
    company-page inbox modal instead of continuing an existing thread.

    Reuses linkedin_reply_check.py's thread-finding approach (match the
    conversation list by the lead's business_name) since that selector set
    is already live-verified against a real LinkedIn inbox -- see that
    module's docstring. The reply-composer selectors below
    (msg-form__contenteditable / msg-form__send-button) are the SAME shared
    LinkedIn messaging widget send_message()'s PERSON path already uses
    (see _PERSON_CONTENTEDITABLE_SELECTOR/_PERSON_SEND_BUTTON_SELECTOR
    above) -- reused here under a separate name since this path opens the
    thread differently (via the inbox list, not a profile's Message
    button), even though the widget itself is identical once open.

    Called by scheduler.py's run_reply_send_cycle() -- a fast poll (~every
    2-3 min), separate from the once-daily run_sending_cycle() above, so a
    reply feels close to real-time. Mirrors send_message()'s own
    bookkeeping (send_status/sent_at/sent_via_account) but deliberately
    does NOT call pipeline.move_stage() or contact_count/first_contacted_at
    -- those already happened when the ORIGINAL outbound message was sent;
    a reply to an ongoing conversation isn't a new first contact.

    If message["attachment_url"] is set (a photo/video/voice note attached
    from "Reply Here" -- see src/lib/outreach/reply-attachments.ts), it's
    downloaded to a temp file (sending/attachments.py) and attached via
    LinkedIn's own file-picker button BEFORE typing the body, so the
    attachment preview is visible before Send is clicked, matching how a
    real person would compose the message. Attachment-picker selector is
    NOT yet live-verified -- same caveat as every other new DOM interaction

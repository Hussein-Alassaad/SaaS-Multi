"""
Sends approved messages on WhatsApp when a public number was found.

Fires for leads from either platform -- WhatsApp is always an ADDITIONAL
channel, never a replacement for the lead's primary platform (see
analysis/whatsapp_detect.py). Twilio is called directly over its REST API
with httpx rather than through the `twilio` PyPI package (see
requirements.txt's note on why that dependency isn't pulled in) -- one HTTP
endpoint doesn't justify an extra SDK.

notifications/whatsapp_notify.py reuses send_text() below for its 5 alert
types -- one Twilio integration, two callers (outreach sends vs. internal
alerts), so credentials and the wire format only live in one place.

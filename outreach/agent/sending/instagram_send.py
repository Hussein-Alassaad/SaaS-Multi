"""
Sends messages on Instagram via the account's own session -- both the
AI-prepared first cold message (approved by a human on the "Instagram"
dashboard page) and replies (typed by a human on "Reply Here").

============================================================================
NOT YET LIVE-VERIFIED -- built against Instagram's known/publicly-documented
DOM structure, same first-pass approach linkedin_send.py originally took
before ITS live verification (see that module's own docstring history).
Every selector below is a reasonable inference, not a confirmed one --
WATCH THIS CLOSELY against a real connected test account before trusting
either path (cold send or reply) unattended, same caution this codebase
applies to every other browser-automation module. Expect to find and fix
real selector mismatches on the first live run, same as
sending/linkedin_reply_check.py's own docstring documents happening there
three separate times.

DELIBERATE PRODUCT DECISION (not a default): earlier versions of this
codebase kept ALL Instagram sending manual (human opens the real app,
copy-pastes, sends) specifically because automating unsolicited cold DMs is
Instagram's highest-risk automation pattern for a ban. This module changes
that -- both the cold message AND replies are now agent-delivered, so the
account is never touched from a different location/IP than the agent's own
consistent proxy. That tradeoff (automation risk vs. location-consistency
risk) was made explicitly by the platform owner, not assumed by this code.
============================================================================

APPROACH: mirrors linkedin_send.py's shape closely --
  - send_cold_message(): opens the lead's profile_url, clicks Message,
    types, sends. This is the ORIGINAL AI-prepared message -- a human still
    approves it (Approval Queue / Instagram dashboard page), this module
    only replaces the "you copy-paste it by hand" step with "the agent
    performs the actual send."
  - send_reply(): opens the existing DM thread (matched by business_name,
    same approach as linkedin_reply_check.py's _open_thread_for_lead) and
    sends into it.

# LIVE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-06: the original substring selector
# ("div[role='button']:has-text('Message')") matched the wrong element --
# Instagram's own top-nav Messages/DM-inbox icon renders as
# div[role='button'] with text "1\nMessages" (unread badge + label), which
# is a substring superset of "Message" and appears EARLIER in DOM order
# than the real per-profile Message button, so .first grabbed the nav icon
# every time. Real profile page dump (hussein._.alassaad, 994 followers):
# the genuine button is div[role='button'] with EXACT text "Message",
# scoped inside <header>, sitting alongside "Follow" as sibling buttons --
# scoping to header AND requiring an exact text match (not substring) is
# what actually disambiguates it from the nav icon.

# would carry an aria-label or placeholder -- the real element has NEITHER
# (page dump: div[contenteditable='true'] with no aria-label, no
# placeholder, no other identifying attribute). It's the ONLY
# contenteditable element on the page once the DM panel is open (confirmed:
# exactly 1 match), so matching plain contenteditable=true is sufficient
# and more robust than guessing at attributes Instagram doesn't actually
# set.
_COMPOSER_SELECTOR = "div[contenteditable='true']"

# the real control is an icon-only paper-plane button, an
# svg[aria-label='Send'] nested inside the clickable element. Playwright
# resolves a click on the svg to its actual pointer target automatically
# (same as clicking any nested icon), so targeting the svg directly is
# reliable and doesn't depend on guessing the wrapping element's tag/role.

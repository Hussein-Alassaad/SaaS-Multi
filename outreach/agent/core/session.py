One isolated Playwright browser context per account, on that account's proxy.

HARD RULE: contexts and proxy IPs never mix between accounts. Each account is
permanently assigned one dedicated sticky residential IP (once proxies are added
in Phase 10). Rotating proxies are never used -- a new IP per request looks like
a bot, which is the opposite of what a sticky proxy is for.

Architecture: ONE shared Chromium process is launched for the whole run (cheap),
and each account gets its own BrowserContext (Playwright's isolated-profile
concept -- separate cookies, storage, and cache per context, like separate
incognito profiles). This gives full isolation between accounts without paying
for 3 separate browser processes.

    with whatever the finishing context happens to hold -- with no lock and no
    validity check. The scheduler's reply-detection poll (~every 3 min) and a
    dashboard-triggered send run in SEPARATE processes (the APScheduler
    container and the control server), so they routinely opened the same
    account concurrently. Both restored the same good session; whichever
    closed LAST overwrote the file. When that last context had been bounced to
    a login/redirect page, it wrote back a cookie-less state over the good one
    -- and the NEXT open() restored that, landed on /login, and reported
    "SessionLoggedOut ... logged_out_chrome=False". Nothing was ever actually
    logged out on LinkedIn's side; the local session file had been clobbered.

# LinkedIn: PARTIALLY live-verified 2026-08-21. Instagram: still unverified.
# ============================================================================
# Every other selector in this codebase (discovery/linkedin.py,
# discovery/instagram.py, sending/linkedin_send.py) was checked against a
# real, live page before being trusted -- that discipline is the reason this
# project's docs (PROGRESS.md) distinguish "built" from "live-tested"
# everywhere. A first live-verification pass on 2026-08-21 (fake credentials,
# no real account -- see PROGRESS.md's dated entry) already replaced this
# module's original, WRONG guesses (id="username"/id="password" -- LinkedIn's
# real login page uses React-generated random ids like «Refvtkejj356d5j6»,
# confirmed live, not stable ids at all) with what was actually confirmed on
# the page. What that pass found and fixed:
#   - Email/password fields: no stable id/name exists -- select by
#     input[type=email]:visible / input[type=password]:visible instead
#     (LinkedIn renders TWO of each, one hidden -- a naive selector without
#     :visible grabs the wrong, non-interactive one).
#   - Submit button: NOT button[type='submit'] (no such element exists on the
#     page at all) and NOT reliably get_by_role('button', name='Sign in')
#     either (that role/name also matches a same-named, zero-height, non-
#     visible duplicate element elsewhere on the page -- confirmed via
#     bounding-box inspection, not assumption). The real, correctly-positioned
#     visible submit sits at [role=button], positioned directly below the
#     password field -- selected below by that positional relationship
#     instead of by role+name alone, which this pass proved isn't unique
#     enough on its own.
#   - navigator.webdriver was True with a plain launch() (Chromium's default
#     automation fingerprint) and LinkedIn's client-side JS silently
#     swallowed every submit click with ZERO network request firing as a
#     result -- no visible error, nothing -- confirmed via an explicit
#     page.on('request', ...) listener, not by watching the page. Fixed at
#     the browser level in __enter__/open() above
#     (--disable-blink-features=AutomationControlled + an add_init_script
#     override); NOT yet re-confirmed end-to-end that a real submit fires a
#     real network request after that fix -- the live-testing pass that would
#     confirm it was intentionally stopped before completing (see
#     PROGRESS.md). That confirmation, or a real supervised login, is still
#     the next required step before this path is trusted with a real
#     account -- same caution already standing for linkedin_send.py's first
#     real Send click.
#
# Instagram's selectors below have had NONE of this live-verification pass --
# they're the same kind of "long-stable elsewhere, not confirmed on this
# page" values LinkedIn's originally-wrong ones were, and LinkedIn's own
# experience above is a concrete demonstration of why that distinction
# matters: do not trust these without the same live-verification treatment
# first.

Runs each tenant's accounts at their own configured times.

PORTED 2026-08-20 to be multi-tenant (see PROGRESS.md's dated entry for the
full writeup). Every orchestration function below now loops over
repo.list_active_tenant_ids() -- every tenant with at least one active
LinkedIn or Instagram OutreachAccount row -- and, within each tenant, over
that tenant's own due accounts (see core/account_pool.py). Each tenant's
whole slice of a cycle runs inside `with repo.tenant_scope(tenant_id):`,
which is what lets every downstream call into messaging/*, crm/*,
sending/*, notifications/*, and core/health.py|warmup.py -- none of which
were changed by this port, none of which know tenant_id exists -- resolve
the right tenant's rows without their call signatures changing (see
db/repositories.py's module docstring, "DISCREPANCY FLAGGED" section, for
why that fallback exists).

Error isolation now has ONE MORE level than before the port: one tenant's
failure must not stop other tenants' processing, in addition to the
existing one-account/one-lead/one-message isolation already in place below.

Two ways to use this module:
  - `run_cycle(...)` does the real work for whichever accounts are due right
    now (or a forced list, for manual testing) -- this is what Phase 2 tests.
  - `build_daily_schedule(...)` wires up APScheduler cron jobs at each
    account's real run_time, for the always-on server from Phase 10 onward.
    It is not exercised during local development, where nothing runs a
    permanent background process.

Manual test trigger (what "Hussein can trigger a run" means in Phase 2):

    "instagram" -- a tenant that only has an active LinkedIn account no

# search for OVERSAMPLE_MULTIPLIER x the daily limit before the loop is

    5 saves (45%). The controlled proof is Insurance's own round 20, whose
    'telecommunications' search happened to render properly: 2 visits, 2
    saves, 0 rejections.

                # whole discovery cycle (_resolve_search_niche, called from
                # _run_discovery_cycle_for_tenant) -- into qualification, even

                # which rotates every round for an empty/service niche via
                # _next_search_terms) is what really found this candidate.
                # LIVE-CONFIRMED tonight: Zimmar and Insurance both searched
                # "construction" in one of their rounds and surfaced the same
                # real companies (Arabian Construction Co., UNITECH, Evans
                # Engineering, Regbar, Murex, ITG Holding, Sword Group,
                # NavLink, Falcon Logistics, ...). Zimmar's fixed top-of-run
                # `niche` happened to be "construction" too, so its
                # _mentions_niche check passed; Insurance's fixed top-of-run
                # `niche` had randomly landed on a DIFFERENT, unrelated word,
                # so the identical real candidates all took the -2
                # "bio does not mention the target niche" penalty and were
                # rejected -- purely from this mismatch, not from being bad
                # leads. Passing `search_niche` (this round's real keyword)
                # instead makes qualify-time relevance always match what was
                # actually searched for. For a tenant with a real configured
                # niche this is a no-op: _next_search_terms only ever PEELS

                # word, so search_niche and niche stay meaningfully the same

# Hashtags that real BUSINESSES tag their own posts with, as opposed to
# hashtags describing a service someone sells. Added 2026-09-13 on the
# owner's explicit instruction ("the hashtags should be related to
# companies, not strictly to cgi or vfx, because we are reaching
# companies"): searching #cgi surfaces other CGI artists showing off their
# work, not the brands who might BUY it. These are the tags a real company
# posts under, so they surface actual businesses.
# REVISED 2026-09-13 after reviewing what these actually returned: the first
# version of this list included "entrepreneur", "business owner", "small
# business" and "startup". On Instagram those are overwhelmingly COACHES,
# consultants and influencers talking ABOUT business -- the exact "we should
# try to not get individuals" problem -- not companies posting their own
# products. Tags kept here are ones a real product business posts under
# while showing its own goods, which is also what makes it a live prospect
# for product visuals, insurance, or security hardware alike.

    Real incident this fixes, live-reasoned 2026-09-08: build_daily_schedule

    once per account instead, right after that account's own discovery run,

    Analysis and message-generation stay here: neither ever touches
    LinkedIn/Instagram/Instagram directly (they read/score leads and call
    Claude to draft text), so they carry none of the automation-fingerprint
    risk that motivated splitting sending out -- there's no safety reason to
    scatter them across every account's own schedule too, only added
    complexity.

    Reply checking (WhatsApp/LinkedIn/Instagram) moved OUT of this cycle
    2026-09-07 onto its own fast poll -- run_reply_detection_poll(), see
    that function's own docstring for the real gap this fixes (a reply
    sitting undetected for up to 24h waiting on this once-daily cycle).
    Follow-up dispatch staying here, on the daily cadence, is still safe
    despite that split: the fast reply-detection poll runs far more often
    than this daily dispatch, so by the time dispatch_due_followups() runs,
    any reply from today has already had many chances to be detected and
    cancel its own follow-up (reply_detection.handle_reply_detected ->
    followup.cancel_pending) well before this step would otherwise
    generate one for someone who already responded.

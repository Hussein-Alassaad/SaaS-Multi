the main Next.js SaaS's own multi-tenant Postgres database (DATABASE_URL)
instead of this standalone project's Supabase client. Left untouched and
unused rather than deleted, so the old single-tenant Supabase project's
connection code stays available for reference. See PROGRESS.md's dated
entry for the migration.

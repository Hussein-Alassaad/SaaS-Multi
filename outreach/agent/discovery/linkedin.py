LinkedIn search and profile reading. Target 30/account/day.

Reads company name, description, headcount, website. Adapts its search terms
when results come back weak -- agentic, not fixed.

============================================================================
VERIFIED against real, live LinkedIn pages -- 2026-07-31, RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-03
============================================================================
Two very different situations, found by inspecting real pages rather than
guessing:

  1. Search (build_search_url / extract_search_results) has NO public
     equivalent -- confirmed both the /about company subpage and the search
     results page hard-redirect anonymous visits to a login page. Verified
     with a real captured login session instead: search itself works fine
     once authenticated, but the results page uses deeply auto-generated,
     non-semantic CSS classes (the same pattern Instagram uses) that are
     useless to select on and will keep changing. The href pattern
     (`/company/<slug>/`) is the only stable part -- each company appears
     3x in the markup (image link, name link, follow-button link), so this
     dedupes on the URL and keeps whichever occurrence actually has text.
  2. Profile reading (extract_company_profile) -- **RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-03,
     selectors changed.** The 2026-07-31 claim that `data-test-id="about-us__*"`
     attributes existed on the bare company page was found to be stale during
     a real supervised discovery run: LinkedIn had redesigned this page and
     those attributes no longer exist anywhere on it (confirmed empty via
     `eval_on_selector_all('[data-test-id]', ...)`). extract_company_profile()'s
     own docstring has the full current selector detail; the short version:
     this function now expects `page` to be on the **`/about`** subpage, not
     the bare page (the bare page is missing the Website/Industry/size info
     entirely) -- scheduler.py's caller was updated to navigate there. The
     original claim that `/about` "redirects anonymous visits to login" turned
     out to only ever have been about *anonymous* visits; every real call site
     here is authenticated (agent/core/session.py), so that redirect never
     actually applied to this codebase's own usage -- confirmed live: `/about`
     renders full real content when logged in. Fixed one real bug found this
     way: the website link's href is a `linkedin.com/redir/redirect?url=...`
     wrapper, not the site itself -- the original code returned that wrapper
     URL verbatim.

    ============================================================================
    RE-VERIFIED live 2026-08-03 -- the dedup rule below was wrong in practice.
    A real supervised discovery run caught every saved lead's display_name
    holding the ENTIRE card's text ("Wooden Bakery Wooden Bakery Food and
    Beverage ServicesBeirutFollowWooden Bakery was founded in..."), not just
    the company name. The original rule ("first truthy text wins, keep it")
    assumed the *wrong* occurrence would have *empty* text (e.g. an image-only
    link) -- but LinkedIn's outer card-wrapping `<a>` (which wraps the image,
    the name, the whole description, and the follower count all in one link)
    also has non-empty text, and Playwright's locator order returned it before
    the inner name-only `<a>`. Confirmed via raw HTML inspection: the real
    name-only link is nested *inside* that outer one
    (`<a href="...wooden-bakery/">Wooden Bakery</a>`, no other text). Since
    the wrapper's text is always a superset of the name link's shorter text,
    keeping the SHORTEST non-empty occurrence per URL reliably picks the real
    name instead of the whole card.
    ============================================================================

    Returns raw dicts: {profile_url, display_name, headline_or_bio}.
    headline_or_bio is always None -- no stable subtitle/tagline element was

    fixed 2026-08-03 after the SAME class of break happened once already) had
    itself silently broken again: LinkedIn moved the bio out of the top-card
    tagline entirely, into the about-module's own body as a plain
    `<p class="break-words white-space-pre-wrap t-black--light
    text-body-medium">` -- confirmed via a real supervised discovery run
    against two real companies (COMPUTEL S.A.L, AQLON Systems), both scoring
    "bio missing" for a description that genuinely was right there on the
    page (`page.locator("p", has_text=...)` found it instantly; the tagline
    selector matched zero elements). That utility-class combination is itself
    too generic/fragile to select on directly (no guarantee LinkedIn doesn't
    reuse those same four classes elsewhere on the page) -- instead scoped to
    the FIRST `<p>` inside `section.org-about-module__margin-bottom` (the
    same stable container Website/Industry/size below already anchor to),
    confirmed live to be exactly one `<p>` in that section, and it's the bio.

    Current real structure (`/about`, authenticated):
      - the bio is the first `<p>` inside `section.org-about-module__margin-bottom`.
      - `/about` no longer redirects anonymous/logged-out visits to login for

        claim was specifically about *anonymous* visits, which was never
        exercised via a real login before) -- every real call site here is

# REMOVED 2026-09-13: has_message_button() used to run at discovery time
# to pre-reject a lead with no working Message button (added after
# TEAMWORK ENERGY failed at send time), but proved to have a ~25%
# false-reject rate on real, reachable companies (LebEx, Bilani
# Transportation, OPES Software, Arab Software Company) even after two
# rounds of tuning its render-wait timing -- the droplet's real CPU
# contention (see session.py's own comment on its 1.9GB RAM/1 vCPU
# constraint) makes a fixed client-side-render wait an unreliable signal.
# Owner's call: losing real leads to false rejects here is worse than a
# genuine no-button lead reaching send time, where
# linkedin_send.py's own NoMessageButtonAvailable is already caught
# cleanly (marks the send failed, doesn't crash) and the owner can now see
# the SPECIFIC reason in the Approval queue rather than a generic
# "Failed" -- see outreach-approvals.ts's own comment on sendStatusReason.

#
# Deploy the Python agent to the droplet, correctly.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# `docker restart nexaris-agent` does NOT pick up a newly built image. A
# container stays bound to the image it was CREATED from, so a rebuild plus a
# restart silently keeps running the old code -- no error, no warning, and the
# deploy looks completely successful. That happened for real on 2026-09-13:
# several rounds of discovery/qualification fixes were built into the image
# but never actually ran, which is why lead quality did not improve.
#
# The only correct sequence is: copy -> build -> RECREATE the container ->
# verify the new code is really loaded. This script does all four, refuses to
# continue if any step fails, and rolls back automatically if the new
# container does not come up healthy.
#
# Usage (from the outreach/ directory):
#   bash deploy.sh                 # deploy + verify
#   bash deploy.sh --verify-only   # just re-run the checks, change nothing

# ANCHORED near a fixed hour (discovery ~23:00/23:02, sending ~10:00), not
# spread across the whole window the way every other tenant (Zimmar,
# mjivity1, future tenants) is via _spread_within_window(). The 2026-09-16
# version made these times perfectly fixed/byte-identical every rebuild;
# the owner then flagged that as its own bot-detection fingerprint (the
# same "same wall-clock minute forever" pattern that got Zimmar's LinkedIn
# account checkpointed), so as of 2026-09-17 each anchor gets its own
# independent +/-_INSURANCE_JITTER_MINUTES (10) jitter, re-drawn every
# build_daily_schedule() call -- see _insurance_jittered_minutes() in
# scheduler.py. Verified three ways: (1) _is_insurance_tenant() correctly
# identifies Insurance by business_name (the same identifier
# messaging/generate.py already keys its own fixed templates on) and
# nothing else; (2) BEHAVIORALLY, by actually calling build_daily_schedule()
# against the real live DB and reading back the real APScheduler jobs it
# produced -- Insurance's discovery/sending jobs must land WITHIN the
# tight +/-10 min band around their anchors on every rebuild, and must
# VARY across independent rebuilds (bounded randomness, no longer a fixed
# minute), while Zimmar's must keep re-randomizing across its own much
# wider spread window; (3) Insurance's per-rebuild range stays tightly
# clustered near its anchor rather than spread across the full 4-hour
# window the way Zimmar's spread mechanism is.

# used to QUALIFY a candidate was the single random word _resolve_search_niche
# picked ONCE at the very top of the whole discovery cycle -- not the
# per-round search_niche that actually found that candidate. Zimmar and
# Insurance both searched "construction" the same night and surfaced the same
# real companies (Arabian Construction Co., UNITECH, Evans Engineering,
# Regbar, Murex, ITG Holding, Sword Group, NavLink, Falcon Logistics); Zimmar
# saved them because its own fixed top-of-run word happened to also be
# "construction", Insurance rejected every one of them because its fixed
# top-of-run word had randomly landed on something unrelated -- same real
# candidates, opposite outcomes, purely from this mismatch. Fix: qualify-time
# niche is now the per-round search_niche, passed via the new
# _save_if_qualified_with_reasons(), not the single fixed niche.

# (the check for the new code failed against what was ACTUALLY running,
# exactly what this script's whole reason-to-exist is), but any of this
# session's earlier edits to those four directories could have silently
# never deployed either, the identical class of bug this script was

# the exact stdin the loop's own `read -r subdir` needs from find's output.
# Confirmed live with `set -x`: the loop ran for exactly ONE subdirectory
# (analysis) then silently stopped, no error, `set -e` never tripped --
# sending/ never got copied a second time even after "fixing" the missing-
# directory bug above, and the very next deploy attempt failed verification
# again on the exact same two checks. `ssh -n` (redirect ssh's own stdin
# from /dev/null instead of inheriting the loop's) is the standard fix for

"""
Per-account warm-up ramp: start at 5/day, climb weekly to the full target.

Steady state is 20 Instagram + 30 LinkedIn per account. Starting there on day
one gets accounts banned. Timing is also varied between accounts so the three
don't look like one operator.

The ramp is computed from the account's `created_at` (when it joined the
pool) rather than a separate "warmup started" column -- one week after
creation is the same thing as one week of warm-up, since a pause is a manual
redistribute decision (core rule R9), never a reason to restart the ramp.

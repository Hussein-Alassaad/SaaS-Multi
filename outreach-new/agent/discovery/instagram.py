Instagram search and profile reading. Target 20/account/day. READ ONLY.

Hashtags and explore pages. Reads bio, followers, post count, and website.
This module NEVER sends -- Instagram's ToS bans automated cold outreach and
automating it risks the account. Only discovery/reading happens here.

============================================================================
VERIFIED against real, live, logged-out public Instagram pages -- 2026-07-31,
RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-03 (hashtag page behaviour changed)
============================================================================
Instagram serves its actual rendered page (not the SSR-disabled shell a bare
HTTP request gets -- confirmed separately) to a real browser, even logged
out, for PUBLIC hashtag/profile/post pages. Two things the original guesses
got wrong, found by inspecting real dumps (instagram.com/nike/, a #bakery
hashtag page, and a real reel page):

**RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-03 -- caught during a real supervised discovery run
that found 0 Instagram leads on every attempt regardless of niche.**
`build_hashtag_url`'s URL shape (`/explore/tags/<tag>/`) still resolves, but
Instagram now hard-redirects it to a generic search page
(`/explore/search/keyword/?q=%23<tag>`, confirmed universal across multiple
tags -- not a #bakery-specific quirk). That page's own post/reel links
render client-side well after `domcontentloaded` fires (confirmed empty
immediately on load; live testing found the delay inconsistent -- a 5s wait
found 0 results on one run and 21 on the next against the identical tag) --
scheduler.py's `_discover_instagram` had no wait at all after `page.goto`
here, so it was reading the page before any results existed. Fixed with an
explicit `page.wait_for_timeout(7_000)` after navigation (7s for margin over
the observed variance). The href-matching logic in extract_hashtag_results()
below is unaffected -- once given enough time to render, the same relative
`/p/<code>/` / `/reel/<code>/` link pattern still works on this redirected
page (confirmed real hrefs are relative, not absolute, so the existing
`href^='/p/'` prefix match was never actually the problem).

  1. Hashtag pages now show Reels (/reel/... links) alongside classic posts
     (/p/...), with NO <article> wrapper -- Instagram's grid items sit behind
     deeply auto-generated, non-semantic CSS classes (e.g. "x1i10hfl xjbqb8w
     ...") that are useless to select on and will keep changing. Matching on
     the href prefix is the only stable part.
  2. The reliable data isn't in visible DOM text at all -- it's in the page's
     `og:description` / `og:url` meta tags (follower/following/post counts as
     Instagram's own formatted string, and the canonical URL with the owning
     username as its first path segment). Semantic, Instagram-authored
     strings, not auto-generated classnames -- far less likely to silently
     break than a CSS selector, and they survive even on pages that also
     render a login-wall overlay over the visible content (confirmed on the
     reel page dump).

**RE-VERIFIED 2026-08-03 -- the bio/website half of point 2 above broke.**
The `"biography":"..."` / `"bio_links":[...]` embedded-JSON fields this
module originally read are gone or wrong now: caught when a real supervised
discovery run returned the identical bio ("🌟") for 5 unrelated real
bakery accounts with 43K-584K followers. Root cause: that JSON key now
belongs to a `["PolarisViewer", ...]` entity -- the logged-in VIEWER's own
profile data, not whichever account's page is being visited. `bio_links`
doesn't exist on the page at all anymore. extract_profile()'s own docstring
has the full replacement: the real bio moved to a plain
`<meta name="description">` tag (not `og:description`, which now only has
the stats line); the website/bio-link is still visibly present but sits
behind a button with no `href` to read statically, so that field is
honestly left as always-None rather than guessed at.

Extraction below reads those meta tags via regex over the raw page content,
not DOM locators, for exactly the semantic-vs-auto-generated reason above.

    module docstring's summary. Full story, caught during a real supervised
    discovery run where every one of 5 real bakery accounts (43K-584K real
    followers) came back with bio == "🌟" (a single star emoji,
    identical across every unrelated account):

    The old `"biography":"..."` embedded-JSON regex WAS matching something
    real -- just not the profile owner. Instagram's hydration payload now
    puts that key under a `["PolarisViewer", ...]` entity -- the currently
    logged-in VIEWER's own data (Hussein's account), not toicroissant's/
    kookies.bakery's/etc. There is exactly one `"biography"` occurrence on
    the whole page and it's always the viewer's, which is why every lead
    got the identical wrong value. The corresponding `"bio_links"` key is
    gone from the page entirely -- confirmed via a plain substring search,
    not just a regex miss.

    The real bio text is genuinely still present, just moved: a plain
    `<meta name="description" content="...">` tag (distinct from
    `og:description`, which only has the stats line now) holds Instagram's
    own `<stats> - @<username> on Instagram: "<bio text>"` string.
    _DESCRIPTION_BIO_RE pulls everything after `on Instagram: "` up to the
    closing `"` -- see that regex's own comment for why it matches a plain
    `"` rather than `&quot;`.

    Website/bio-link extraction was NOT fixed here and now always returns
    None/False -- the visible link ("share.google/... and N more") sits
    behind a `<button>` with no `href` at all (confirmed live: Instagram
    now requires an actual click to reveal/navigate the bio link, there is
    no static attribute to read). Website presence was already just one of
    several qualify.py signals (2 points out of a multi-factor score), not
    load-bearing on its own, so this is a real, honestly-flagged gap rather

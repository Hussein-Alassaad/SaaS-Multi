"""
Checks LinkedIn for replies to leads we've messaged, via a real logged-in
browser session -- the piece crm/reply_detection.py's module docstring
explicitly deferred until linkedin_send.py's own live-account access existed.

============================================================================
RE-VERIFIED LIVE 2026-08-08 against Hussein's real messaging inbox, after
two real sends (Paul Bakery Beirut, George Gemayel) -- 3 real, confirmed
bugs found and fixed. No actual reply existed yet to test the "lead
replied" branch itself (both leads had a single message: our own outbound
send) -- see the note on sender-detection below for what that means for
confidence level.
============================================================================
1. `_CONVERSATION_LINK_SELECTOR` assumed an `<a href="...">` to match
   against `profile_url`'s slug. The real element
   (`msg-conversation-listitem__link`) is a plain `<div>` with NO href
   attribute at all -- confirmed by inspecting the raw captured HTML, not
   guessed. That made every lookup silently fail; `_open_thread_for_lead`
   would return False for every lead, always. Fixed by matching on the
   conversation's visible participant-name text instead (real DOM:
   `h3.msg-conversation-listitem__participant-names` contains the exact
   business name, e.g. "Paul Bakery Beirut" -- confirmed present verbatim
   for both real leads messaged so far) rather than a URL that was never
   there.

2. `_THREAD_MESSAGE_TIMESTAMP_SELECTOR`'s `<time>` element has NO `datetime`
   attribute in the real DOM -- confirmed live, it only contains human text
   ("8:29 PM"). The old code's `get_attribute("datetime")` always returned
   None, so `_newest_message_if_from_lead` always bailed out immediately
   regardless of whether a reply existed. There's no reliable absolute
   timestamp in the DOM at all for a same-day message (LinkedIn shows
   relative/short text, not ISO), so this function now only checks whether
   the newest message's sender is the lead, dropping the
   newer-than-last-send timestamp comparison entirely (see below).

3. The docstring's own claim -- "absence of a sender-link element means
   this is our own message" -- was the wrong way around. The real captured
   thread's ONLY message so far is OUR OWN outbound send, and it DOES carry
   a `msg-s-message-group__profile-link` span with the sender's name
   ("Hussein Alassaad") inside it. LinkedIn appears to label every message
   group's sender, not just the other party's. Fixed by matching the
   sender-name text against the LEAD's business_name specifically, instead
   of inferring identity from whether a link element exists at all.

STILL NOT FULLY VERIFIED as of 2026-08-08: neither test lead had actually
replied yet at that point, so the true positive path (a real reply
detected and correctly attributed) had not been exercised end to end.

2026-09-07: ported the same real-conversation-sync rework already
live-verified on instagram_reply_check.py's identical function (see that
module's own docstring for the specifics that were confirmed live there,
against a genuine multi-message conversation with real incoming replies
and manually-sent outgoing messages both present). The underlying
mechanics -- content-based dedup, checking "replied" leads too, not just
"contacted", backfilling manually-sent outgoing messages so Reply Here
shows the real full conversation -- are IDENTICAL logic between the two
platforms (see _sync_thread_messages() below, byte-for-byte the same
approach as Instagram's). What's genuinely different, and still NOT
live-verified on LinkedIn specifically, is the sender-identification
mechanism this relies on (_read_thread_messages()'s reliance on LinkedIn's
own message-group sender labels, carried forward across consecutive
same-sender messages) -- every account available the night this was
written was already degraded from unrelated testing, so this hasn't had
its own real multi-message LinkedIn conversation to confirm against yet.
Watch this closely against the first real one.

APPROACH: pull-based, same shape as whatsapp_reply_check.py. For every
lead at "contacted" OR "replied" that we reached via LinkedIn (not
WhatsApp -- that channel's own checker already covers WhatsApp-contacted
leads), open the account's own messaging inbox, find that lead's
conversation thread by its business_name, and read every message in it,
tagged by sender name.

This is real browser automation, not a public API -- the same
automation-detection exposure linkedin_send.py itself already carries.
Runs on its own fast poll now (scheduler.py's run_reply_detection_poll(),
~every 3 min), not the old once-daily full-pipeline cadence -- see that
function's own docstring for why that changed 2026-09-07.

    Identical logic to instagram_reply_check.py's _sync_thread_messages()
    -- see that function's own docstring for the full reasoning. Dedup by
    CONTENT within each direction (no stable per-message id available from
    either platform's DOM), so a body already known on the matching side is
    treated as already-recorded; a genuinely new message on either side
    gets backfilled into the correct table.

    Compares NORMALIZED text (see _normalized_for_dedup's own comment for
    the real duplicate-row bug this closes) -- whitespace/newline
    differences between our stored body and LinkedIn's own DOM rendering
    of the same message must never be read as "this is a new message".

    REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED 2026-09-18, live-confirmed against lead
    "Khatib & Alami" (Insurance tenant): _read_thread_messages() labels
    direction from LinkedIn's own per-message-group sender name, carried
    forward across consecutive unlabeled messages (see that function's own
    docstring). That labeling is UNCONDITIONALLY TRUSTED here -- a message
    the DOM tags "lead" was inserted straight into outreach_replies with
    zero cross-check against what we already know we sent. Confirmed live:
    a re-render of our OWN already-sent message got mislabeled "lead" (the
    carry-forward name was almost certainly stale, likely due to the
    "This message has been deleted." tombstone bubble between it and the
    last genuinely-labeled message not carrying a sender name of its own),
    and landed in outreach_replies as a fabricated reply -- content
    byte-for-byte our own outbound body, whitespace/newlines flattened by
    LinkedIn's DOM the same way _normalized_for_dedup already exists to
    handle.

    Fix: before accepting ANY candidate labeled "lead", cross-check its
    normalized text against known_outgoing (bodies we already know we
    sent, per outreach_messages) FIRST. A match means this is our own
    message misread off the page, not a real reply -- skip it entirely
    (no outreach_replies insert, no handle_reply_detected(), no status
    flip). This is additive on top of whatever the DOM-labeling heuristic
    already does, and does not require that heuristic to be perfectly
    correct -- it only needs this one content-based safety net to catch
    the failure mode at the last point before bad data is written.
    Mirrors the safety Instagram's own _sync_thread_messages() already has
    (there, content match against known_outgoing is checked before ANY
    position-based guess is even attempted -- see that function's own
    docstring); LinkedIn never had the equivalent check because it always
    trusted the DOM's own label first instead of deriving direction from
    content the way Instagram does.

"""
Checks Instagram for replies to leads we've messaged, via a real logged-in
browser session -- Instagram's equivalent of linkedin_reply_check.py.

============================================================================
LIVE-VERIFIED 2026-09-07 against a real conversation with a genuine
incoming reply ("Thanks", from hussein._.alassaad) -- the ORIGINAL
selectors below were all wrong and have been replaced; see each constant's
own comment for exactly what real inspection found.
============================================================================

APPROACH: pull-based -- for every "contacted" OR "replied" lead reached
via Instagram, open the account's own DM inbox, find that lead's thread by
its business_name, and read the ENTIRE thread (not just the newest
message -- see _sync_thread_messages()'s own docstring for the real gap
that fixed, 2026-09-07). Every message not already recorded is backfilled
into the correct table by direction: a lead's message becomes a new
OutreachReply row (and advances the pipeline via handle_reply_detected()),
our own message (including one sent manually from the real Instagram app,
outside this platform entirely) becomes a new OutreachMessage row -- so
Reply Here shows the REAL, complete conversation regardless of how each
message was actually sent. Reuses instagram_send.py's
_CONVERSATION_LIST_ITEM_SELECTOR constant so the two modules can't
silently drift out of sync on how a thread is located.

# LIVE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-07: the original div[role='row'] selector matched
# ZERO elements in a real open thread -- Instagram's message bubbles carry
# no ARIA role at all, and there's no labeled/roled container wrapping the
# message list either (walked every ancestor from a real reply's text node
# to the document root: exactly one had any role/aria-label at all, a
# role='button' hover target on the bubble itself, not a list container --
# confirmed live, not assumed). Each message bubble (both incoming and
# outgoing) IS a div[role='presentation'], confirmed by finding they line
# up 1:1 with the visible message bubbles in chronological order.
#
# The one real wrinkle: the FIRST role='presentation' match on the page is
# sometimes unrelated sidebar chrome ("What's new... Your note"), not a
# message -- present only when that inbox-wide prompt hasn't been
# dismissed. Since there's no clean container to scope into instead, this
# is filtered by content instead of position: an element whose direct text
# is exactly that sidebar prompt's own copy is excluded, everything else
# role='presentation' on the page is treated as a message bubble. Scoped
# to whatever the caller navigated to (a specific /direct/t/<id>/ thread
# URL), not the inbox list page, so this never picks up unrelated
# role='presentation' elements from a different part of the app.

    session made _open_thread_for_lead silently return False (the
    conversation list item just never "found"), which reported an
    identical "replied": False result as a lead that genuinely hasn't
    replied yet -- a real false negative with no visible error, exactly
    the failure mode a human scanning "not yet replied" against their own
    real inbox (see this codebase's own Reply Here warning banner) exists
    to catch, but silently, indefinitely, is a much worse outcome than
    surfacing it as a real error the moment it happens.

    LIVE-CONFIRMED 2026-09-07, second fix: an instant .count() check
    right after page.goto() reads 0 even when the conversation genuinely
    exists and renders moments later -- same timing race found and fixed
    in every other Instagram/LinkedIn selector tonight. wait_for() catches
    it once actually rendered.

    Third fix, same night: landing on the home feed first (not straight
    into the inbox) before checking replies, matching the same warm-up
    added to instagram_send.py's send_reply() -- see that function's own
    comment for the reasoning. This read-only check itself never actually
    lost a session tonight (only the SEND path did), but applying the same
    more-human navigation pattern here too is cheap defense-in-depth, not
    a reaction to a failure specific to this function.

    Reads EVERY message bubble currently in the open thread, in
    chronological order, as {"text", "left"} -- NOT yet tagged with a
    direction. Real gap fixed 2026-09-07: the original version of this
    function only ever looked at the SINGLE NEWEST message -- live-confirmed
    the same night, a message sent manually from the real Instagram app
    (not through this platform) was correctly excluded from
    outreach_replies (it's genuinely ours, not a reply), but that also
    meant it never showed up anywhere on the dashboard at all -- Reply Here
    only ever displays OutreachMessage rows (platform-originated sends)
    plus OutreachReply rows (detected incoming replies), so a real, genuine
    part of the conversation was invisible. Reading the WHOLE thread, not
    just the tail, is what lets the caller backfill a manually-sent
    outgoing message the same way it already backfills an incoming reply.

    REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED 2026-09-16 -- direction used to be decided
    RIGHT HERE, by comparing each bubble's horizontal position against the
    THREAD's OWN AVERAGE left offset ("us" if right of average, "lead" if
    left). That silently assumes both sides are actually represented in
    the thread. Instagram's DOM carries no reliable absolute per-bubble
    signal for "sent by me" (confirmed 2026-09-07 -- no distinguishing
    ARIA role/class on either side, see this module's own docstring), so a
    thread holding ONLY our own messages (the common case: a fresh lead
    that hasn't replied yet) has no real "left" cluster at all -- the
    average sits in the middle of OUR OWN bubbles, and roughly half of our
    own outgoing messages end up left of it and get misclassified as if
    they came from the lead. LIVE-CONFIRMED against 5 real leads
    (meteorintheyks, hnmoverseas, al_mosbah_, lafe.leb,
    lets_travel_and_discover): each had a thread with ONLY our own
    template's opening/closing lines in it, no real reply ever received,
    yet this logic fabricated 3 "lead" messages per thread out of our own
    pitch text, flipping the lead to "replied" on fake evidence.

    Fix: this function no longer guesses a direction at all -- it just
    returns each bubble's text and left offset. _sync_thread_messages()
    below does the actual classification, anchored to CONTENT already
    known to be ours or the lead's (not position), and only falls back to
    position when the thread has at least one bubble already confirmed on
    EACH side to calibrate against. See that function's own docstring for
    the full reasoning and the safe-skip fallback when no such anchor
    exists yet.

    Real gap fixed 2026-09-07: Reply Here only ever displayed
    OutreachMessage rows (platform-originated sends) and OutreachReply
    rows (detected incoming replies) -- a message sent manually from the
    real Instagram app, outside this platform, was correctly excluded
    from being mistaken for a reply, but that also meant it was invisible
    on the dashboard entirely, even though it's a genuine part of the
    real conversation.

    Dedup by CONTENT within each direction, not a stable message id --
    Instagram's DOM exposes no per-message identifier to key off (see
    _read_thread_messages' own docstring), so a body already known on the
    matching side is treated as already-recorded. Known real limitation:
    two literally-identical messages on the same side (e.g. sending "K"
    twice) are indistinguishable this way and the second one won't be
    backfilled -- accepted the same way the single-newest-reply version
    of this function already accepted it for the incoming side alone.

    Compares NORMALIZED text (collapsed whitespace, see
    linkedin_reply_check._normalized_for_dedup's own comment for the real
    bug this closes -- "identical logic" per this function's own docstring
    above means this file inherited the exact same one): our stored body
    keeps real paragraph breaks, but the live DOM can render the identical
    message as one flat run with no line breaks at all, which read as "a
    new message" on every poll and silently inserted a duplicate DB row
    for a message that was only ever really sent once.

    pre-decided on each `live_messages` entry (`msg["from"]`), computed by
    _read_thread_messages() from bubble position alone. See that
    function's own docstring for the live-confirmed false-positive this
    caused on 5 real leads. Direction is now decided HERE, per bubble,
    anchored to CONTENT already known to be ours or the lead's:

      1. A bubble whose normalized text is already in `known_outgoing` (a
         body we already have on file for this lead) or `known_incoming`
         (a reply we already recorded) is that side, full stop -- no
         position involved, and this is also what makes the existing
         dedup-by-content below a no-op for anything already on file.
      2. A genuinely NEW bubble (matches neither known set) gets a
         position-based guess whenever THIS READ already has at least one
         bubble it could content-match to `known_outgoing` (our own sent
         message) -- `confirmed_us_lefts` below. The guess compares the
         new bubble's `left` against the average `left` of those
         confirmed-"us" bubbles.
      3. Otherwise (this read has no bubble it can content-match at all --
         e.g. a stale/empty page load) direction is UNKNOWN and the bubble
         is skipped -- neither recorded as a reply nor backfilled.

    REAL BUG FOUND AND FIXED 2026-09-19: step 2 used to ALSO require
    `known_incoming` to be non-empty (a reply already confirmed on a
    PRIOR run) before ever trusting a position-based guess -- reasoned as
    "the thread is confirmed two-sided". That reasoning silently excluded
    the single most common real case: a lead's FIRST EVER reply, which by
    definition happens while known_incoming is still empty. Two real
    leads (fadeltradingcompany, titus.logistics) each sent a real first
    reply on Instagram that this exact gate skipped outright -- confirmed
    live, zero rows in outreach_replies for either despite a real reply
    screenshot from the owner. Every lead's first reply hit this same
    silent gap, every time, since that is always the moment
    known_incoming is empty. The real risk the original fix protected
    against -- a thread with ONLY our own messages having no genuine
    "left" cluster to average against -- is fully covered by requiring
    confirmed_us_lefts (content-matched "us" bubbles from THIS read)
    to be non-empty; requiring a PRIOR confirmed reply on top of that
    added no extra safety, it only ever cost the first-reply case.

    Returns (new_replies_recorded, new_outgoing_backfilled).

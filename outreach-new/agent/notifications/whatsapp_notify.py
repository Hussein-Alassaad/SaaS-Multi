"""
The 5 WhatsApp alert types, sent to the configured recipient numbers.

1. Hot lead (score 8-10) -- fires immediately on scoring, not at end of run.
2. Founder found. 3. Account warning (with type and reason). 4. Approval
reminder to Mohamad. 5. Daily summary with exact finish time and duration.

Sends through sending/whatsapp_send.py's raw Twilio call -- same
credentials, same HTTP client, as outreach sending. If Twilio isn't
configured yet (agent/.env's WHATSAPP_* fields are blank until a real
account exists) or a send fails, every function below still composes the
correct message and logs it via notifications_log -- only the actual
delivery is skipped, the same graceful-degradation pattern
agent/analysis/client.py uses for a missing Claude key. A notification
failing to deliver must never break whatever pipeline step triggered it
(e.g. a hot-lead alert firing mid analysis cycle), so both the "not
configured yet" case and a genuine Twilio/network failure are swallowed
here, not just the former.

All Claude prompt templates, structured for prompt caching.

The instruction blocks below are identical across every lead, so they are
marked cacheable via `cache_control` on the system text block -- only the
per-lead data in the user message varies from call to call. This is the main
cost lever on an estimated 4,500 leads/month: Anthropic charges a fraction of
the normal input-token rate for a cache hit, and every lead after the first
in a given analysis run hits the cache for these instructions.

publicly-scraped data about one business found on LinkedIn or Instagram. Produce a deep, honest \
assessment of the business, from the outside, based only on what's given -- do not invent facts \
not supported by the input.

Assess:
- company_size: your best estimate of employee headcount, as a short range (e.g. "5-15") \
or null if there's no signal at all.
- revenue_tier: one of "micro", "small", "medium", "large", based on audience size, \
activity level, and any pricing/scale signals in the bio or website -- null if no signal.
- industry: the specific industry/niche this business operates in, in a few words.
- website_notes: if a website is present, a short honest note on its apparent visual \
quality (product photography/video quality, whether the brand looks premium or dated, \
clarity and impact of hero imagery) based on what's in the input -- null if no website.
- ads_running: true/false/null -- true only if there is an explicit signal the business \
runs paid ads (e.g. a "sponsored" marker, an ad-library mention); null if unknown.
- social_platforms: array of every platform this business appears active on, based on \
the input (e.g. ["instagram", "website"]).
- weak_points: the FULL list of weaknesses you can identify that are relevant to what \
{name} offers ({description}) -- concrete, specific gaps this business has that {name}'s \
services could plausibly address. List every one you find, do not summarise or cap the list.
- ai_opportunities: for each weak point (or generally), a specific way {name}'s services \
could plausibly help THIS business -- concrete, not generic, grounded in what {name} \
actually offers ({description}).

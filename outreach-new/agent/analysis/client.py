"""
Shared Claude API client for the analysis and messaging pipelines.

Mirrors db/client.py's pattern from Phase 1: one lazily-created client, reused
by every module that calls Claude, so credentials are only ever read from
config in one place. Lives in analysis/ because it was built first for Phase
4, but nothing about it is analysis-specific -- Phase 5's messaging/generate.py
uses it too.

# run_message_generation_cycle, each looping over every eligible lead) could
# stall that entire cycle for up to 10 minutes before the SDK's own retry
# logic even gets a chance to move on. Tightened to something a single
# lead's analysis/message call has no legitimate reason to exceed.
# max_retries is the SDK's existing default (2) -- set explicitly so it's a
# documented choice here rather than an unstated library default.
